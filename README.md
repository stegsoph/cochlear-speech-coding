# Sound Coding in Cochlear Implants

## Overview of the following coding schemes:

- Single Channel CI 
- Multi Channel CI
- Feature Extraction Strategy F0-F2
- Feature Extraction Strategy F0-F1-F2
- Continuous Interleaved Sampling – CIS
- Spectral-PEAK
- Advanced Combination Encoder– ACE
- Fine Structure Processing - FSP

## Coding language and dependencies:

This project is written in *Julia* in the IJulia browser-based enviroment Jupyter Notebook. The notebook relies on the following packages

	PyPlot
	PyCall
	WAV
	DSP
	FFTW

which can be installed in the Julia command line by typing  

``` 
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Package Name")
```
