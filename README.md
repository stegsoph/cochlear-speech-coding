# To-Do-List

* add a function to determine whether the frame is voiced or unvoiced
* based on that rework the last implemented algorithms

* algorithms still to implement: 

	o Feature Extraction Strategy F0-F1-F2
	
	o Continuous Interleaved Sampling – CIS
	
	o Spectral-PEAK [seligman+1995]
	
	o Advanced Combination Encoder– ACE (only frame rate is different)
	
	o Fine Structure Processing – CSSS (see MedEl video)
