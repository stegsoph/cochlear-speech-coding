- add a function to determine whether the frame is voiced or unvoiced
- based on that rework the last implemented algorithms

- algorithms still to implement: 
	o Continuous Interleaved Sampling – CIS
	o Spectral-PEAK [seligman+1995]
	o Advanced Combination Encoder– ACE (only frame rate is different)
	o Fine Structure Processing – CSSS (see MedEl video)
